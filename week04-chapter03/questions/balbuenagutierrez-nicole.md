The chapter notes that managers often make decisions based on inadequate information and value employees who 'have their back' in public. In a client meeting, if a senior MD makes a strategic error or a 'ridiculous' request, how can a junior professional maintain a united front to protect the firm's reputation while still fulfilling their duty to tell the truth and protect the accuracy of the technical analysis? At what point does the 'long game' of building loyalty require you to argue the decision privately afterward?
