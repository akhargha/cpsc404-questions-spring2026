## Question

Chapter 3 talks a lot about loyalty as something you show “up” to your manager and “down” to the organization, but I’m stuck on how to handle loyalty when goals *conflict* across teams. In real workplaces, your manager might be pushing speed and output, while another team you depend on is optimizing for risk control, quality, or process.

How do you practice **constructive loyalty** in that situation without becoming the “difficult person” or looking like you’re not a team player? Specifically: what’s the best way to raise concerns (or disagree) so you’re still loyal to your manager’s goals, but also loyal to the broader organization and the people who will deal with the fallout if something goes wrong?
